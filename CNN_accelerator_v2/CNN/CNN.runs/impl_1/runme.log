WARNING: [DRC REQP-1839] RAMB36 async control check: The RAMB36E1 design_1_i/mem4096X32_0/inst/mem_reg_0 has an input control pin design_1_i/mem4096X32_0/inst/mem_reg_0/ADDRBWRADDR[10] (net: design_1_i/mem4096X32_0/inst/address2[7]) which is driven by a register (design_1_i/process_ctrl_0/inst/feature_addr_reg[7]) that has an active asychronous set or reset.
